28634686,The founders and the classics,Carl J Richard,1994,Harvard University Press,History ,Is our Greek and Roman heritage merely allusive and illusory? Or were our founders  and so our republican beginnings  truly steeped in the stuff of antiquity? So far largely a matter of generalization and speculation  the influence of Greek and Roman authors on our American forefathers finally becomes clear in this fascinating book - the first comprehensive study of the founders\ classical reading  Carl J  Richard begins by examining how eighteenth-century social institutions in general and the educational system in particular conditioned the founders to venerate the classics  He then explores the founders\ various uses of classical symbolism  models  antimodels  mixed government theory; pastoralism  and philosophy  revealing in detail the formative influence exerted by the classics  both directly and through the mediation of Whig and American perspectives  In this analysis  we see how the classics not only supplied the principal basis for the U S  Constitution but also contributed to the founders\ conception of human nature  their understanding of virtue  and their sense of identity and purpose within a grand universal scheme  At the same time  we learn how the classics inspired obsessive fear of conspiracies against liberty  which poisoned relations between Federalists and Republicans  The shrewd ancients who molded Western civilization still have much to teach us  Richard suggests  His account of the critical role they played in shaping our nation and our lives provides a valuable lesson in the transcendent power of the classics ,24 cm,b38631209,JA84.U5 R48,eng,phxx0,"Political science -- United States -- History -- 18th century;""Political science -- Greece -- History"";""Political science -- Rome -- History"""

E\ possibile riprodurre le strutture di un\altra lingua in forma non meccanica? E\ lecito espandere il testo evangelico desumendo informazioni dal contesto? In queste pagine vengono affrontati analiticamente 300 passi del vangelo di Luca in cui la versione siriaca presenta letture che si discostano dal greco in modo significativo  Tali devianze sono state classificate secondo i processi che le hanno presumibilmente generate  cercando di stabilire quali fossero i meccanismi in atto al momento di procedere alla traduzione del testo  Alla prova dei fatti  la Vetus Syra si rivela una buona traduzione  piu\xcc\x80 preoccupata di rendere il senso del testo che non la sua letteralita\xcc\x80  Isolando i fattori che provocano la maggior parte delle varianti  tra i quali l\assimilazione interna e sinottica  si e\xcc\x80\xcc\x80 in grado di individuare alcuni fattori ermeneutici che sono stati significativi per i traduttori: il confronto con le scuole esegetiche del tempo  l\accentuazione della centralita\xcc\x80 della figura di Cristo  la ridefinizione di alcuni personaggi minori che assumono valore paradigmatico per i credenti  ecc --Publisher description ,21 cm.,b38587087,BS2595.52 .C37 2013,ita,txxx0,"Bible.

647901911,Monotheism between pagans and Christians in late antiquity,"Stephen Mitchell,  Peter van Nuffelen",2010,Peeters,History ,The fourth century was a major religious battleground  The rise of Christianity  and in particular its dominance from Constantine onwards  marked an important shift in the religious history of the Mediterranean  Christianity saw this change as the victory of its monotheism over the polytheism of paganism  This volume studies how similarities between paganism and Christianity were obscured in the polemic that was waged by Christianity against paganism and in the pagan responses to it  A recurring theme in the papers shows that a concrete religious issue lay at the heart of such polemic: which god can one worship? Christians would restrict worship to their Gid  whereas pagans accepted cultacts for the many traditional deities  The debate about monotheism was therefore not just about conceptions of the divine  but was part of the creation and defence of social  cultural  and religious identities in Late Antiquity  In exploring how the notion of monotheism was shaped by Late Antiquity polemic and how this still influences our understanding of it  this volume also hopes to inform contemporary debates about the dangers of monotheism ,24 cm.,b36391955,BR170 .M65 2010,eng,txxx0,"Monotheism -- History;""Christianity and other religions -- Greek"";""Christianity and other religions -- Roman"";""Theology -- History -- Early church, ca. 30-600"";""Paganism -- History"""

777327389,The language of disenchantment,Robert A Yelle,2013,Oxford University Press,,The Language of Disenchantment explores the ways in which Protestant ideas concerning language influenced British colonial attitudes toward and proposals to reform Hinduism  Protestant literalism  mediated by the textual economy of the printed book  inspired colonial critiques of Indian mythological  ritual  linguistic  and legal traditions  Central to these developments was the transportation of the Christian opposition of monotheism and polytheism or idolatry into the domain of language  Polemics against verbal idolatry that had been applied previously to Catholic and sectarian practices in Britain -including the elevation of a scriptural canon over heathenish custom  the attack on the personifications of mythological language  and the critique of vain repetitions in prayers and magic spells-were applied by colonialists to Indian linguistic practices  In order to remedy these diseases of language  the British attempted to standardize and codify Indian traditions as a step toward both Anglicization and Christianization  The colonial understanding of a perfect language as the fulfillment of the monotheistic ideal echoed earlier Christian myths according to which the Gospel had replaced the obscure discourses of pagan oracles and Jewish ritual  By uncovering the historical roots of the British re-ordering of South Asian discourses  Yelle\s work challenges representations of colonialism  and the modernity that it ushered in  as simply rational or secular --Publisher\s website ,24 cm,b38342613,BL1215.C76 Y45 2013,eng,txxx0,"Hinduism and culture -- India;""Language and languages -- Religious aspects -- Hinduism"";""Hinduism -- India"";""Protestantism -- Influence"""

Many authors have proposed succinct but abstract definitions  The author of this book prefers to start with concrete historical experience  He focuses more on what fascists did than on what they said  Their first uniformed bands beat up enemies of the nation  such as communists and foreign immigrants  during the tense days after 1918 when the liberal democracies of Europe were struggling with the aftershocks of World War I  Fascist parties could not approach power  however  without the complicity of conservatives willing to sacrifice the rule of law for security  The author makes clear the sequence of steps by which fascists and conservatives together formed regimes in Italy and Germany  and why fascists remained out of power elsewhere  Fascist regimes were strained alliances  While fascist parties had broad political leeway  conservatives preserved many social and economic privileges  Goals of forced national unity  purity  and expansion  accompanied by propaganda driven public excitement  held the mixture together  War opened opportunities for fascist extremists to pursue these goals to the point of genocide  The author shows how these opportunities manifested themselves differently in France  in Britain  in the Low Countries  and in Eastern Europe  and yet failed to achieve supreme power  He goes on to examine whether fascism can exist outside the specific early twentieth century European setting in which it emerged  and whether it can reappear today  This book  based on a lifetime of research  will have a lasting impact on our understanding of twentieth century history ,21 cm,b38645488,JC481 .P373 2005,eng,phxx0,"Fascism;""Europe -- Politics and government -- 20th century"""

32371646,Beyond left and right,Anthony Giddens,1994,Stanford University Press,,How should one understand the nature and possibilities of political radicalism today? The political radical is normally thought of as someone who stands on the left  opposing backward-looking conservatism  In the present day  however  the left has turned defensive  while the right has become radical  advocating the free play of market forces no matter what obstacles of tradition or custom stand in their way  What explains such a curious twist of perspective? In answering this question  Giddens develops a new framework for radical politics  drawing on what he calls philosophic conservatism  but applying this outlook in the service of values normally associated with the left  The ecological crisis is at the core of this analysis  but is understood by Giddens in an unconventional way - as a response to a world in which modernity has run up against its limits as a social and moral order  The end of nature  as an entity existing independently of human intervention  and the end of tradition  combined with the impact of globalization  are the forces which now have to be confronted  made use of and coped with  This book provides a powerful interpretation of the rise of fundamentalism  of democracy  the persistence of gender divisions and the question of a normative political theory of violence  It will be essential reading for anyone seeking a novel approach to the political challenges we face at the turn of the twenty-first century ,24 cm,b38645968,JA71 .G53 1994,eng,hxxx0,"Conservatism;""Radicalism"";""Welfare state"""

Tauris,History ,Early twentieth-century Iran had been dominated by the competing influences of the two great imperial powers of the time - Russia and Britain - making it difficult for a third power to establish a foothold  But an emergent  highly industrialised and assertive Germany in the 1930s became an attractive ally through which Iran could cut loose from domination by Britain and the Soviet Union  allowing it to seek modernity outside the constraints of old imperial interests  This led to the development of close commercial ties between Reza Shah\s Persia and Hitler\s Germany in the interwar period  an aspect of German foreign policy that is often overlooked  It was the National Bank of Persia  established in 1927 under German management  and with Kurt Lindenblatt as its governor  that was to be the vehicle for Germany\s commercial expansion into Iran  The Bank was a vital engine driving industrialisation  even after Lindenblatt retired and was followed by Gholam Reza Amir-Khosrari and a board of directors including Hossein Ala and Abdul Hossein Hazhir  By the mid-1930s  a new German foreign policy approach of active diplomacy fortified initial inroads into the Iranian economy  building upon the foundations laid by individual entrepreneurs  the National Bank and the construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway  Iran evolved into an attractive country for international trade and  at the outbreak of World War II  Germany was Iran\s largest trading partner - surpassing both the Soviet Union and Britain  These close ties reveal a complex relationship between Germany and Iran  and an admiration of the Nazi\s brand of industrial  scientific and organisational progress  It was  however  a relationship that came to an abrupt end with the Allied invasion of Iran in 1941 that deposed the Shah  Khatib-Shahidi delves into previously untapped German primary sources to explore the nature of German involvement in Iran between the wars  examining how it came to be moulded by a handful of individuals  This book is a revealing resource on the historical ties between Iran and Germany  making it indispensable for students and researchers of European Imperialism and Colonialism in the Middle East as well as of Iranian Political and Economic History --Publisher\s website ,23 cm.,b38589588,DD120.I55 K43 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Germany -- Foreign relations -- Iran;""Bānk-i Millī-i Īrān -- History"";""Investments, German -- Iran -- History -- 20th century"";""Iran -- Foreign relations -- Germany"";""Germany -- Foreign relations -- 1918-1933"";""Germany -- Foreign relations -- 1933-1945"";""Germany -- Foreign economic relations -- Iran"";""Iran -- Foreign economic relations -- Germany"""

Annegret Fauser explores these and many other questions in the first in-depth study of American concert music during World War II  While Dinah Shore  Duke Ellington  and the Andrew Sisters entertained civilians at home and G I s abroad with swing and boogie-woogie  Fauser shows it was classical music that truly distinguished musical life in the wartime United States  Classical music in 1940s America had a ubiquitous cultural presence--whether as an instrument of propaganda or a means of entertainment  recuperation  and uplift--that is hard to imagine today  and Fauser suggests that no other war enlisted culture in general and music in particular so consciously and unequivocally as World War II  Indeed  the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor  Group Theatre director Harold Clurman wrote to his cousin  Aaron Copland: So you\re back in N Y     ready to defend your country in her hour of need with lectures  books  symphonies!

Approaching this question from across the disciplines  Naked Exhibitionism examines the evolution of female exhibitionism from criminal taboo to prime-time entertainment  Taking an interdisciplinary approach which brings together all fields of popular culture  including literature  media  film and linguistics  Claire Nally and Angela Smith offer an examination of gendered exhibitionism from the mid-twentieth century to the present day  They ask whether bodily exposure provides the liberation it professes to or restricts our most secret selves to the sanitised realm of socially-sanctioned gender roles  From the art of burlesque as a riotous kingdom of the imagination to reality TV which helps women to unearth their \true\ and buried feminine selves  Nally and Smith explore how the critical history and theory of exhibitionism intersects with the wider movement towards gender equality  Examining effects of second-wave feminism to problematise the naked female form  female and gender-transgressive performers from Bette Davis to Dita von Teese are placed in their cultural context  In order to demonstrate that female exhibitionism remains at the heart of popular culture  this book also examines the works of Peter Ackroyd and the controversial playwright Sarah Kane  uncovering the contradictions behind the evolving representations of public exposure  Within a post-feminist framework  the cultural constructions behind the repackaging of female exhibitionism are explored and the prominence of bodily exposure in popular culture examined  along with the implications of those artists who perform gender as a public masquerade  Finally  hit TV shows Ladette to Lady and How to Look Good Naked are interrogated to expose the buried contradictions behind this public unveiling: are women seizing control of their own identity  or is this revelation an illusion?

The Posthuman concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities  Braidotti outlines new forms of cosmopolitan neo-humanism that emerge from the spectrum of post-colonial and race studies  as well as gender analysis and environmentalism  The challenge of the posthuman condition consists in seizing the opportunities for new social bonding and community building  while pursuing sustainability and empowerment ,23 cm,b38649767,BD450 .B73 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Philosophical anthropology;""Human beings"""

Fredrik Albritton Jonsson recovers the forgotten networks of improvers and natural historians that sought to transform the soil  plants  and climate of Scotland in the eighteenth century  The Highlands offered a vast outdoor laboratory for rival liberal and conservative views of nature and society  But when the improvement schemes foundered toward the end of the century  northern Scotland instead became a crucible for anxieties about overpopulation  resource exhaustion  and the physical limits to economic growth  In this way  the rise and fall of the Enlightenment in the Highlands sheds new light on the origins of environmentalism--  This is the first book to explore the environmental foundation of the Scottish Enlightenment  Such a perspective sheds new light on one of the great problems of social theory: What are the causes and limits of economic development? The first part of the book recounts how natural historians turned Highland Scotland into a practical laboratory and internal frontier after 1745  They sought to make northern Scotland into a cornucopia by transforming local ecosystems  soils  and even the climate itself  They also promoted maximum population growth by advocating a new standard of minimal subsistence based on spade husbandry  But these projects provoked political controversy as well as unintended social consequences  The second section shows how conservative and liberal improvers clashed over the fit between the environment and the social order  Adam Smith\s defense of free markets presumed an ideal order of self-regulating natural systems whereas his critics stressed the need for human expertise and government to regulate fragile environments  These two rival ecologies of development have left a deep mark on the history of capitalism and conservationism  The final part of the book charts the collapse of the improvement schemes in the north  Now the region became the stage for a political debate about the physical limits to growth  feeding new fears of overpopulation  coal exhaustion and the stationary state  The book thus excavates the idealized vision of nature in Adam Smith\s defense of free markets and also reveals how the Scottish Enlightenment helped give birth to modern environmentalism--,25 cm.,b3865121x,GE199.G7 J66 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Environmentalism -- Scotland -- History -- 18th century;""Enlightenment -- Scotland"";""Scotland -- Intellectual life -- 18th century"";""Highlands (Scotland) -- Environmental conditions -- History -- 18th century"""

Partiality presents a theory of the reasons supporting special treatment within special relationships and explores the vexing problem of how we might reconcile the moral value of these relationships with competing claims of impartial morality  Simon Keller explains that in order to understand why we give special treatment to our family and friends  we need to understand how people come to matter in their own rights  Keller first presents two main accounts of partiality: the projects view  on which reasons of partiality arise from the place that people take within our lives and our commitments  and the relationships view  on which relationships themselves contain fundamental value or reason-giving force  Keller then argues that neither view is satisfactory because neither captures the experience of acting well within special relationships  Instead  Keller defends the individuals view  on which reasons of partiality arise from the value of the individuals with whom our relationships are shared  He defends this view by saying that we must accept that two people  whether friend or stranger  can have the same value  even as their value makes different demands upon people with whom they share different relationships  Keller explores the implications of this claim within a wider understanding of morality and our relationships with groups  institutions  and countries --Book jacket ,23 cm.,b38651385,HM1106 .K4395 2013,eng,hxxx0,Interpersonal relations -- Philosophy

If we do not know what democracy means  then why is it forcefully driving our politics and societies?

We generally think of democracy as government by consent; a government of  by  and for the people  This has been true from Locke through Lincoln to the present day  Yet in understandably stressing the importance--indeed  the monumental achievement--of popular consent  we commonly downplay or even denigrate the role of dissent in democratic governments  But in Government by Dissent  Robert W T  Martin explores the idea that the people most important in a flourishing democracy are those who challenge the status quo  The American political radicals of the 1790s understood  articulated  and defended the crucial necessity of dissent to democracy  By returning to their struggles  successes  and setbacks  and analyzing their imaginative arguments  Martin recovers a more robust approach to popular politics  one centered on the ever-present need to challenge the status quo and the powerful institutions that both support it and profit from it  Dissent has rarely been the mainstream of democratic politics  But the figures explored here--forgotten farmers as well as revered framers--understood that dissent is always the essential undercurrent of democracy and is often the critical crosscurrent  Only by returning to their political insights can we hope to reinvigorate our own popular politics --Publisher\s description ,24 cm,b38652870,E310 .M37 2013,eng,hxxx0,"United States -- Politics and government -- 1783-1809;""Dissenters -- United States -- History -- 18th century"";""Opposition (Political science) -- United States -- History -- 18th century"";""Democracy -- United States -- History -- 18th century"";""Federal government -- United States -- History -- 18th century"";""Government, Resistance to -- United States -- History"""

Prior to the 1920s  courts generally refused to enforce such agreements  and parties had the right to bring their disputes to court  However  during the 1920s  Congress and state legislatures suddenly enacted ground-breaking laws declaring that arbitration agreements are \valid  irrevocable  and enforceable \ Drawing on previously untapped archival sources  this book explores the many different people  institutions  forces  beliefs  and events that led to the enactment of modern arbitration laws during the 1920s  and it explains why America\s arbitration laws radically changed during this period  By examining this history  this book demonstrates how the U S  Supreme Court has grossly misconstrued these laws and unjustifiably created an expansive  informal  private system of justice touching almost every aspect of American society and impacting the lives of millions--Unedited summary from book cover ,23 cm,b38653655,KF9085 .S98 2013,eng,hxxx0,Arbitration and award -- United States -- History

826293824,Pathology of the capitalist spirit,David P  Levine,2013,Palgrave Macmillan,,Capital represents our dissatisfaction with the world we live in  what we have and what we don\t have  and is therefore hope and desire embodied  Pathology of the Capitalist Spirit is about capital and about the economic system that bears its name  In this humanist look at capitalism  Levine explores the meaning of capital as a social reality connected to fundamental human aspirations  The link between capital and the pursuit of a hoped-for state is especially important in light of the stubborn insistence on the part of its critics that capitalism exists to serve the material interests of those whose vocation is to own capital  This misunderstanding ignores what is essential about capital  which is its link not to interests but to hope  especially the hope that by accumulating capital the individual can achieve an attachment to the good  It is this hope that blocks tolerance of any notion that there is something unfair in the capitalist\s acquisition of wealth and that fairness can be achieved through its redistribution to others  It is also this hope that animates the capitalist system as a whole  And in that sense  this hope is the spirit of capitalism  To develop this theme  Levine calls on the ideas and writings of major theorists involved with understanding modernity and capitalism: Adam Smith  Karl Marx  Max Weber  Emile Durkheim  and Joseph Schumpeter ,23 cm.,b38653679,HB501 .L3973 2013,eng,hxxx0,Capitalism -- Philosophy

Through what narrative and visual devices are some social hierarchies destabilized while others remain hegemonic? How should we understand the sacrifices characters make in the name of justice  and comprehend their failures in achieving it? Asking such questions casts light on the film s eccentricities and internal contradictions and suggests the possibility of new interpretations of a culturally iconic text  The book examines the context that gave meaning to the film s representation of race and how debates about family  community  and race are played out and reframed in law ,24 cm,b38654039,PS3562.E353 T654 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Lee, Harper.

In Fascist Voices  Christopher Duggan draws on thousands of letters sent to Mussolini  as well as private diaries and other primary documents  to show how Italian citizens lived and experienced the fascist regime under Mussolini from 1922-1943  Throughout the 1930s  Mussolini received about 1 500 letters a day from Italian men and women of all social classes writing words of congratulation  commiseration  thanks  encouragement  or entreaty on a wide variety of occasions: his birthday and saint\s day  after he had delivered an important speech  on a major fascist anniversary  when a husband or son had been killed in action  While Duggan looks at some famous diaries--by such figures as the anti-fascist constitutional lawyer Piero Calamandrei; the philosopher Benedetto Croce; and the fascist minister Giuseppe Bottai--the majority of the voices here come from unpublished journals  diaries  and transcripts  Utilizing a rich collection of untapped archival material  Duggan explores the cult of Il Duce  the religious dimensions of totalitarianism  and the extraordinarily intimate character of the relationship between Mussolini and millions of Italians  Duggan shows that the figure of Mussolini was crucial to emotional and political engagement with the regime; although there was widespread discontent throughout Italy  little of the criticism was directed at Il Duce himself  Duggan argues that much of the regime\s appeal lay in its capacity to appropriate the language  values  and iconography of Roman Catholicism  and that this emphasis on blind faith and emotion over reason is what made Mussolini\s Italy simultaneously so powerful and so insidious  Offering a unique perspective on the period  Fascist Voices captures the responses of private citizens living under fascism and unravels the remarkable mixture of illusions  hopes  and fears that led so many to support the regime for so long --Publisher description ,25 cm,b38654994,DG571 .D84 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Italy -- History -- 1922-1945;""Fascism -- Social aspects -- Italy"";""Fascism and the Catholic Church -- Italy"";""Fascism and culture -- Italy"";""Mussolini, Benito, 1883-1945 -- Public opinion"""

This innovative book argues that not only are animals worthy recipients of justice  but that the language of justice offers a stronger base of claims for animal advocates than does the language of ethics or morality  Contending that a genuinely political theory of animal rights must go beyond the level of ideal theory  this is the first account of animal ethics to use nonideal theory to plot a course from where we are now to where we want to be  Robert Garner argues that a valid theory of justice for animals should be rights-based  and that animals have a right to not suffer at the hands of humans  At the same time  he argues that humans have a greater interest in life and liberty than most species of nonhuman animals  Tackling animal ethics as it relates to justice and non-ideal theory  this is a seminal work that will challenge traditional approaches and offer a compelling new vision of animal justice --Back cover ,25 cm,b38655536,HV4708 .G387 2013,eng,hxxx0,Animal rights

805013900,Emotion and imagination,Adam Morton,2013,Polity,,In recent years have seen an enormous amount of philosophical research into the emotions and the imagination  but as yet little work has been done to connect the two  In this book  the author shows that all emotions require some form of imagination and goes on to fully explore the link between these two important concepts both within philosophy and in everyday life  We may take it for granted that complex emotions  such as hope and resentment  require a rich thinking and an engagement with the imagination  but the author shows how more basic and responsive emotions such as fear and anger also require us to take account of possibilities and opportunities beyond the immediate situation  The book highlights that many emotions  more than we tend to suppose  require us to imagine a situation from a particular point of view and that this in itself can be the source of further emotional feeling  It goes on to demonstrate the important role that emotions play in our moral lives  throwing light on emotions such as self-respect  disapproval  and remorse  and the price we pay for having them  He explores the intricate nature of moral emotions and the challenges we face when integrating our thinking on morality and the emotions  This book challenges many assumptions about the nature of emotion and imagination and will appeal to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the role that these concepts play in our lives  -- From publishers website ,22 cm,b38662590,B105.I49 M67 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Imagination (Philosophy);""Imagination"";""Emotions (Philosophy)"";""Emotions"""

In this thought-provoking narrative--drawn from professional expertise as well as personal life experiences--trailblazing neurophilosopher Patricia S  Churchland grounds the philosophy of mind in the essential ingredients of biology  She reflects with humor on how she came to harmonize science and philosophy  the mind and the brain  abstract ideals and daily life  Offering lucid explanations of the neural workings that underlie identity  she reveals how the latest research into consciousness  memory  and free will can help us reexamine enduring philosophical  ethical  and spiritual questions: What shapes our personalities? How do we account for near-death experiences? How do we make decisions? And why do we feel empathy for others? Recent scientific discoveries also provide insights into a fascinating range of real-world dilemmas--for example  whether an adolescent can be held responsible for his actions and whether a patient in a coma can be considered a self  Churchland appreciates that the brain-based understanding of the mind can unnerve even our greatest thinkers  At a conference she attended  a prominent philosopher cried out  I hate the brain; I hate the brain! But as Churchland shows  he need not feel this way  Accepting that our brains are the basis of who we are liberates us from the shackles of superstition  It allows us to take ourselves seriously as a product of evolved mechanisms  past experiences  and social influences  And it gives us hope that we can fix some grievous conditions  and when we cannot  we can at least understand them with compassion --Publisher\s description ,22 cm,b38663338,QP360 .C485 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Neuropsychology -- Philosophy;""Cognitive science -- Philosophy"";""Brain"""

What kind of threat did it represent? How has our understanding of deconstruction changed over time? This book offers an account of the invention and reinvention of deconstruction in literary studies and the humanities more generally  Focusing on the work of Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man  it argues that the early impact of deconstruction was connected to its perceived assault upon truth  After de Man\s death there is a steady insistence in Derrida\s work on questions about time - invention  advent  event - and on the distance between them  This book tells the story of this transition from truth to time against a background of some of the most divisive debates of the late-twentieth and early twenty-first century  about politics  history and ethics--,23 cm,b38671074,PN49 .C785 2013,eng,hxxx0,"Literature -- History and criticism -- Theory, etc;""Literature -- Philosophy"";""Analysis (Philosophy)"";""Deconstruction"";""Criticism"";""LITERARY CRITICISM / General. bisacsh"";""LITERARY CRITICISM / European / General. bisacsh"";""LITERARY CRITICISM / Semiotics & Theory. bisacsh"""

812067441,Violence,Richard J  Bernstein,2013,Polity,,We live in a time when we are overwhelmed with talk and images of violence  Whether on television  the internet  films or the video screen  we can\xca\xb9t escape representations of actual or fictional violence - another murder  another killing spree in a high school or movie theatre  another action movie filled with images of violence  Our age could well be called The Age of Violence because representations of real or imagined violence  sometimes fused together  are pervasive  But what do we mean by violence? What can violence achieve? Are there limits to violence and  if so  what are they? In this new book Richard Bernstein seeks to answer these questions by examining the work of five figures who have thought deeply about violence - Carl Schmitt  Walter Benjamin  Hannah Arendt  Frantz Fanon  and Jan Assmann  He shows that we have much to learn from their work about the meaning of violence in our times  Through the critical examination of their writings he also brings out the limits of violence  There are compelling reasons to commit ourselves to non-violence  and yet at the same time we have to acknowledge that there are exceptional circumstances in which violence can be justified  Bernstein argues that there can be no general criteria for determining when violence is justified  The only plausible way of dealing with this issue is to cultivate publics in which there is free and open discussion and in which individuals are committed to listen to one other: when public debate withers  there is nothing to prevent the triumph of murderous violence  -- Publisher description ,24 cm,b38671578,B105.V5 B47 2013,eng,hxxx0,Violence -- Philosophy
