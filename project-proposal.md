Why is your project important?
Why is it interesting as a Big Data problem and who would use it if it were solved?*

Madelynn Dickerson, the information resources coordinator at the Claremont Colleges Library, approached our professor, Mariam Salloum, about having students expand upon a research project within the class Big Data: Applications/Platforms. Dickerson and other librarians piloted a project [described here](http://madelynndickerson.wixsite.com/dh4collections) that could be greatly aided by the tools of Big Data. Dickerson described the project as such:

> \[The Critical Collection Analysis Project] was a pilot study of the ways in which text analysis and other digital humanities tools could be used to understand and evaluate library collections. A team of four librarians collected data about book records created and added to Claremont’s library management system between 1995 – 2015.  The initial study focused on identifying trends in collecting practices of print books related to terrorism.  Book records were downloaded and title information was uploaded to Voyant Tools for text analysis in order to answer questions about how print collecting in terror studies has changed over time. In addition, timelines were created to understand how the library’s collecting patterns aligned to changes in the national political landscape. Our goal for taking this project to the next level is to build a functional, sustainable and user-friendly database of historic library book records for future study.

The pilot project is where our project begins. But first, why is a project like the Critical Collection Analysis project important?

Libraries are flexible spaces that allow people to explore an inclusive range of resources. As such, it is important for a library to have diverse perspectives on an issue so people can create well-rounded opinions. Curators of libraries decide what information is available for its attendants. uman bias is inherent and unavoidable in the resource acquisition process. The project provides an easily executable way to examine possible biases in library collections. Once aggregated and accessible in a database, users can compare the collections of a library to those of other libraries. Additionally, librarians can use text analysis to find to analyze the sentiment and perspective towards a specific topic. Text analysis has its limitations; it is reductivist in the sense that it simplifies an author’s argument, and it is also limited by the human bias of the software developer. However simple, our project is important because text analysis would provide a way to analyze the bias of large library collections quickly and with little effort. 

Much of Big Data is often the process of cleaning and wrangling data. The library's current dataset is unworkably dirty since it comes from two databases, one of which is outdated. Much of the libraries work on the pilot project involved **manually** cleaning the dataset. We will first clean the dataset by using an API to retrieve clean information about all of the recorded books. We will then quantify the amount of books on a given topic and compare it to the amount of books on the same topic at a different liberal arts college's library. Our high reach goal for this semester is to use text analysis on excerpts of books from a specific topic to analyze the bias, if any, of the collection at the Claremont Colleges Library.
