What is the goal of this project?
Why is your project important?
Why is it interesting as a Big Data problem and who would use it if it were solved?*

Madelynn Dickerson, the information resources coordinator at the Claremont Colleges Library, approached our professor, Mariam Salloum, with the idea of a project that students in the class Big Data: Applications/Platforms could help complete. Dickerson described the project as such:

>This project was a pilot study of the ways in which text analysis and other digital humanities tools could be used to understand and evaluate library collections. A team of four librarians collected data about book records created and added to Claremont’s library management system between 1995 – 2015.  The initial study focused on identifying trends in collecting practices of print books related to terrorism.  Book records were downloaded and title information was uploaded to Voyant Tools for text analysis in order to answer questions about how print collecting in terror studies has changed over time. In addition, timelines were created to understand how the library’s collecting patterns aligned to changes in the national political landscape. Our goal for taking this project to the next level is to build a functional, sustainable and user-friendly database of historic library book records for future study.

However, the library much of the libraries work on the project involved manual cleaning of data
